Now the rest of the meal will take less than 25 minutes: 10 minutes to boil the pasta, make the sauce, and assemble the dish (and, if youre like me, some sub-urb biscuits), and 15 minutes to bake it (while you make  a quick salad).  So be ready.\nI melt my butter in my wok over high heat.  I throw my pasta nests into the salted boiling water on the back burner.\nWhen my butter is melted and just begging to tan, I add my heavy cream and blend well.  I bring this to a simmer for a moment.\nThen I add 3\/4 of my cheese, which Ive shredded. (The rest I will thinly shave for a final garnish.)\nI blend this well, bringing it to a low simmer to thicken, until it forms a smooth sauce.  I also add some salt and pepper.  (Crushed red pepper flakes, nutmeg, paprika, maybe even a dash of curry powder would work nicely here, too.)\nFinally, I add 3\/4 of my cooked bacon, and blend well with the sauce, until the flavors are beautifully infused.\nIts  been 10 minutes, and my 11 minute pasta is just slightly undercooked (I know, cuz I bit off a snippet)  perfect!  Using tongs and a meshed spoon, I transfer my pasta to the waiting bacon cream, and toss well.  I add a tablespoon, maybe, of the pasta water, too, just to keep the sauce wet enough to bake later.\nUsing my tongs, I spin 1\/2 of the pasta and sauce into each of two medium (10oz) ceramic ramekins, which Ive brushed down with melted butter.  I sprinkle most of the rest of my bacon (reserving a few chunks for a final flourish) on top.\nThe piece of resistance: a whole, cracked, raw egg, dropped into a wee basket I left in the middle of my pasta and sauce nests.  I manage to keep the yolk whole only in one, but the other I rather hold together by virtue of a cleverly placed noodle and some dribbled sauce.  I place these into a 350 oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until the whites have set, but the yolk is still glossy and runny.\nAfter coring the best bits out of a loaf of bread destined for nothing (since my husband purchased a fresher loaf of preferred pan this afternoon) with a properly sized wine-glass rim, I brushed each disk with melted butter, and layered them with some of my sprinkled cheese into 4 cups of a buttered muffin tin, and then I stuck them in my oven along with my pasta nests to brown.  I consider these my sub-urb Wonderbread biscuits: quick, easy, and yummy, leaving fodder for crotons (or compost).  I also threw together a quick salad of baby greens, sliced onion, strips of roasted red peppers, black olives, EVOO, and salt and pepper.

The sisters also suggest adding nutmeg, to taste, if you like!\nOnce the mixture is seasoned to your liking, add in two eggs and water and mix again until the eggs have been fully incorporated!\nNow stuff the mixture into each of the shells.

As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.\nOnce your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.\nNow you'll want to take about a 1\/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.\nTake the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.\nRoll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.\nThe final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil.

Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels.

By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).<\/li><li>Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.<\/li><li>Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.<\/li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.<\/li><\/ol>","ingredient_names":["butter","double cream","egg","flour","granny smith apples","ground almonds","ground cinnamon","juice of lemon","full-fat cream cheese","sugar","sea salt","sugar","sugar","sugar","vanilla extract"]},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":13,"preparationMinutes":10.0,"cookingMinutes":25.0,"aggregateLikes":5,"healthScore":22,"pricePerServing":352.45,"id":639722,"title":"Coconut and Whole Wheat Chicken Tenders","readyInMinutes":30,"servings":2,"summary":"You can never have too many main course recipes, so give Coconut and Whole Wheat Chicken Tenders a try.

Blanch the onions in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking. Slice the end tips off of the onions, peel the onions and score the root end with 1\/4 inch cuts. Saut onions in a single layer in a tablespoon or two of butter until lightly browned. Add chicken stock or water half way up the sides of the onions. Add a teaspoon of sugar, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer slowly for 25 minutes or until tender. The onions should absorb most of the water. If there is water remaining after cooking, drain the excess. Set aside.<\/li><li>Prepare the mushrooms a few minutes before serving the stew. Saut quartered mushrooms in a few tablespoons of butter and olive oil until browned and cooked through.<\/li><li>When the stew meat has cooked sufficiently, remove all solids from the sauce (except the beef) by draining through a colander set over a saucepan. Return the beef to the casserole. Press juices out of the residue into the cooking liquid, then remove any visible fat and boil down the liquid to 3 cups. Off heat, whisk in the beurre mani, then simmer for 2 minutes as the sauce thickens lightly. Correct seasoning and pour over the meat, folding in the onions and mushrooms. To serve, bring to a simmer, basting meat and vegetables with the sauce for several minutes until hot throughout.<\/li><\/ol>","ingredient_names":["bacon","beef chuck","bouquet garnic","butter","beef broth","carrots","chicken stock","cremini mushrooms","flour","olive oil","onions","pearl onions","red wine","salt and pepper","tomatoes"]},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":4,"preparationMinutes":10.0,"cookingMinutes":25.0,"aggregateLikes":2,"healthScore":1,"pricePerServing":113.96,"id":658727,"title":"Rocky Road Rice Krispie Treats","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":24,"summary":"Rocky Road Rice Krispie Treats requires around <b>45 minutes<\/b> from start to finish.

Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the cake with an even layer of the simple syrup.  Trim the second layer of cake and place on a cooling rack. Brush with simple syrup and set aside. Discard any left over syrup.\nAllow syrup to soak into the cake layers for about 5 or 10 minutes.\nSpread about a cup of frosting over the top of the first cake layer to about a  inch from the edge. Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the frosting to about an  inch from the edge of the frosting.\nCarefully place the second layer of cake on top of the first layer being careful not to put too much pressure on the filling. You dont want the filling to start to ooze out from the sides of the cake.\nTake about 1 cup of frosting out of the bowl and put it into a smaller bowl. This is to prevent the chocolate crumbs from the cake to get into the bowl of frosting.\nYou dont want flecks of cake in your white frosting.\nSpread a thin but even layer of frosting on the sides of the cake. Be sure to fill the space between both cake layers with frosting. This will trap the filling between both cake layers.\nFrost the top of the cake with a thin layer of frosting.\nChill for about an hour to set the frosting.\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top.\nForm an edge in the frosting on the top of the cake by pushing down into the frosting and building up a ledge of frosting with a small spatula along the edge of the cake.\nYou may have to even out the frosting in the center by removing a thin layer  of frosting until the edges are higher then the center of the cake.\nAdd cherry pie filling to the top filling in the center of the frosting.\nChill before serving.","ingredient_names":["duncan hines devil's food cake","comstock cherry pie filling","cream cheese","powdered sugar","whipping cream","almond extract","simple syrup glaze","water","sugar"]},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":5,"preparationMinutes":10.0,"cookingMinutes":25.0,"aggregateLikes":2,"healthScore":1,"pricePerServing":28.78,"id":644690,"title":"Gingerbread Pancakes","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":16,"summary":"Gingerbread Pancakes might be just the breakfast you are searching for.
